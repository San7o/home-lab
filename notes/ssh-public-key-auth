ssh public key authentication
=============================

Generate a public/private key pair for ssh:

   mkdir -p ~/.ssh && chmod 700 ~/.ssh
   ssh-keygen

Set our key to a remove server:

   On the server:

      touch ~/.ssh/authorized_keys && chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

   On the client:
   
       ssh-copy-id [username]@[hostname_or_ip]

To disable password authentication, edit the file `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`
and set "PasswordAuthentication" to "no".
