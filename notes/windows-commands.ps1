# Quick tip: you can use the new windows terminal on windows
# 10 by installing it from the microsoft store. The windows
# terminal has some multiplexing features built-in which are
# very useful.
#
# To get an up to date powershell, you need to download it
# and install it from the official website -- do not use the
# default powershell because it is really old! -- and then
# configure the terminal to use the new shell.
#
# To install program, you can use `winget` which is a command
# line packet manager, in the style of Linux's packet managers.
#
# Note: to run some of the following commands you need to run
# the shell as administrator.

# Windows sandbox
# ---------------
#
# Windows Sandbox is a lightweight, isolated desktop
# environment that allows users to safely run applications
# without affecting their main operating system.
#
# To enable Windows Sandbox, you need to open "Turn
# Windows features off and off" and enable it, then
# restart the machie.
#
# Sandboxes are defines as a XML file, for example the
# following creates an isolated sandbox that can access
# the Download folder in read only mode, and it runs
# the explorer when it starts:
#
# <Configuration>
#   <VGpu>Disable</VGpu>
#   <Networking>Disable</Networking>
#   <MappedFolders>
#     <MappedFolder>
#       <HostFolder>C:\Users\Public\Downloads</HostFolder>
#       <SandboxFolder>C:\temp</SandboxFolder>
#       <ReadOnly>true</ReadOnly>
#     </MappedFolder>
#   </MappedFolders>
#   <LogonCommand>
#     <Command>explorer.exe C:\temp</Command>
#   </LogonCommand>
# </Configuration>
#
# To run the sandbox, you need to save the XML as
# a .wsb file and then double click or run `start`
# on it.

# WSL
# ===
#
# Installing WSL is quite straight forward, just run
#     wsl --install
