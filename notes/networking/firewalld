firewalld
=========

Firewalld is a firewall daemon. It is managed via the firewall-cmd
command line utility.


Zones
-----

Firewalld is logically divided into zone and the traffic flowing
between them can be governed by policies

Firewalld follows some strict principles in regards to zones:

1. Traffic ingresses one and only one zone
2. Traffic egresses one and only one zone
3. A zone defines a level of trust
4. intra-zone (within the same zone) is allowed by default
4. inter-zone (zone to zone) is denied by default

To list the available zones, run:

```
firewall-cmd --get-zones
```

To list the currently active zones:

```
firealld-cmd --get-active-zones
```

To inspect a particular zone:

```
firewall-cmd --zone=public --list-all
firewall-cmd --list-all-zones
```

You can configure firewalld in `/etc/firewalld`


Creating services
-----------------

To create a service and open a port, use the following commands:

```
sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-service=http
sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-service=http --permanent
```

A service is a configuration which contains some ports. In this
case the service was already defined by the distribution.

```
sudo firewall-cmd --info-service=http
```

To see all the predefined services, use:

```
firewall-cmd --get-services
```

To create a custom service, run:

```
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --new-service=myapp
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --service=myapp --set-description="My Custom Enterprise App"
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --service=myapp --add-port=8080/tcp
```

Verify your changes:

```
sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --list-services
sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --list-ports
```

Reload the firewall after making changes:

```
sudo firewall-cmd --reload
```
