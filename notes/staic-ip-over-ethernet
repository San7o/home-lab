static ip over ethernet
=======================

This is a quick reference to show you the commands for setting a
static ip on two computers connected via ethernet so that they can
communicate.

First we need to add an ip to both machines. You need to know the name
of your ethernet interface, you can use a command line `ifconfig`;
here we use `eno1` as the ethernet interface name. Note that both
machine need to use the same network (same netid and netmask).

Machine1:

    sudo ip addr add 192.168.0.2/16 dev eno1

Machine2:

    sudo ip addr add 192.168.0.3/16 dev eno1

If you run `ifconfig` you should see the ip address
assigned to the ethernet interface.

Next we create a route from Machine 1 to Machine 2

    sudo ip route add 192.168.0.3 dev eno1 via 0.0.0.0

This way we can can ping Machine 3:

    ping -I eno1 192.168.0.3

That's it. You can see a list of the configured routes
with:

    ip route

Here is an example on how to use scp to copy files over ssh:

  scp machine1@localhost:/some/path/ machine2@192.168.0.3:/your/path/
