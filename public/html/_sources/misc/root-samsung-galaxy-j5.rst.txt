Rooting android your first time is a frustrating experience at best.
It took me more than necessary to get root privileges on my phone,
therefore I am writing a quick guide for my future self when he will
need my assistance. This document explains the steps I took to
successfully root my android phone.

Note that the process may vary in several ways, mainly depending on
the model of the phone you are trying to root. This guide is written
specifically for the Samsung Galaxy J5 (2016), however most of the
steps should be similar hopefully. It is advised to read this article
first before attempting to root your phone.

The process
-----------

To root a phone we need something with root privileges to grant us the same
status. Of course, stock Android will never let us get even a glimpse of this
power for security reasons so we need to find a workaround.  The solution is to
boot a custom recovery image, which has high privileges, to install some
applications with root status. We can leverage this to install a special app
that gives permissions to other apps during normal system execution.

To recap, we need to do the following to achieve root:

1. Boot a custom recovery image
2. Install a special application
3. Enjoy the power

Note that you might mess things up and lose all your data, so be prepared.
Probably you will also lose your device's warranty.

You have been warned :-)

1. Boot a custom recovery image
------------------------------

We need to download a custom recovery image for your phone model. There are many
good alternatives, I used TWRP and it can be downloaded from the official
website. Note that you need to choose the right version based on your phone.  I
downloaded the ``.img`` file, compressed it in a tar archive and renamed it
``recovery.tar``.

.. code-block:: bash

   wget https://.../something.img
   tar -cf something.tar something.img
   mv something.img recovery.zip

Now we need to put this into our device. We need to boot into download mode
which on my smartphone is ``VOL_DOWN + HOME + POWER``. After this we can
interact with the device, I used ``odin4`` (linux version) for this. To check
that oding can talk to the device, run ``odin4 -l`` and expect some output. If
it does not show anything I cannot help you, it is probably a driver problem,
good luck, I believe in you, trust in yourself, you are strong. If you get some
permission error, you need to set something on your udev, just follow closely
the help output and you should be good to go.

Then load the recovery mode with ``odin4 -a recovery.zip`` and, IMMEDIATELY
after it finishes, you need to boot in recovery mode, which on my phone is done
via ``VOL_UP + HOME + POWER``. You need to be QUICK, REALLY QUICK!!! Keep trying
until you manage to do this. If everything was successful, you are now greeted
with a cool recovery program.

2. Become root
--------------

We now need to install something that will make other things root. We can use
Magisk, you can download the apk from the official github releases and rename it
to a ``.zip`` file. We need to send it to the device and we will use ``adb``
from the official platform tools. Just extract the archive.

On the device, select ``advanced -> sideload -> swipe to start
sideload``.  On your pc, run ``adb sideload app-release.zip``, this
should install magisk and it should show the installation on the
phone. After this finishes, reboot your phone, go to your apps and
open Magisk, it may ask to be installed again, just say yes, follow
the installation instructions (just tap two buttons), maybe close it
and reopen it, reboot and...  we are root!

You can check this by installing RootChecker.

3. Enjoy the power
------------------

Now that you are root you can do a bunch of cool things like wipe out everything
and install gentoo. A more useful thing would be to install an adblocker (I'd
suggest ``adAway``) so that you can actually read blogs and news in peace.

Installing an alternative OS
----------------------------

There are plenty of alternatives and variations of Android out there, the only
constraint is that they need to support your phone.  You could theoretically
make your own build but I have no idea how you would resolve drivers. I aplogize
for my ignorance, you'll have to figure it out some day.  I found `this
<https://community.e.foundation/t/unofficial-builds-samsung-galaxy-j5-series-for-e-os-r/56461/3>`_
unofficial build of eOS, hopefully the link still works.

After you have installed the custom recovery media, you can start the sideload
just as you did for Makisk in the previous section, and load the downloaded
archive. That is really it, you should have a working OS.  If the process fails
and you cannot boot the OS correctly, you should be able to access the recovery
mode on startup assuming that you can turn off your device. In my experience,
when the boot broke, I could not power it off so I just removed the battery and
rebooted. Unfortunately, you cannot do this in new phones (sight), so you may
try to make it discharge until ti powerd off, gook luck.
