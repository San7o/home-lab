RSS Guide
=========

RSS is a standard format to let a client access updates from a website. The
standard is xml based, feeds files (usually ending with .rss or .xml) have at
least a title, a link and a description, and zero or more feed items.  The way
this works is that a server would host the .rss or .xml file on some url, then
the client would fetch the xml file and parse it locally: if the client did not
have any of the fetched feed items locally, it will notify the user that a new
item has been updated and it will update It's local copy.

In other words, the client would compare the newly fetched feed file and a
previous local version (if it had one), then if the fetched file has more items
this means that a new item was published. The way this notification is presented
depends on the client you are using, as well as the frequency of fetching the
updates which you can usually change.

RSS Clients
-----------

There are a large number of free and open source clients out there, you may try
some and see If you like any of them or just write your own since it is very
simple. For emacs, you could use Gnus_, Elfeed_ or NewsTicker_ (which comes by
default in emacs since emacs 22) or any other. I tried all three of them and
they are great, I like NewsTicker interface but gnus is more powerful so I use
gnus on my daily workflow.

There are many alternatives outside of emacs, both GUI and tui such as `tiny
tiny RSS`_. A quick search online would help you find the most suitable one for
your liking.

How do you use a client
-----------------------

The usage is usually quite straightforward: you add the url of the feed to your
client and you update the feeds when you want to check for new publications. The
client will query all the urls of the feeds you set up and show you the results.

Atom
----

I really like the simplicity of RSS. An alternative you may find online are
Atom_ feeds which were created to address some of the limitation of RSS by being
more extensible and flexible, but it works exactly the same for the most part so
you can apply what you learned about RSS to Atom. Usually clients can read both.
